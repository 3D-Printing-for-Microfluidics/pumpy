# pumpy
Python RSâ€“232 interface for Harvard Pump 11, Pump 11 Plus and PHD2000 syringe pumps. Written by [Thomas W. Phillips][TWP]

## Requirements

Requires [PySerial][]. Developed on Mac OS 10.9.1 with Python 2.7.3 ([Enthought Canopy][] 7.3.1 64-bit) and PySerial 2.6.

## Usage

Two possibilites:

1. Command line interface. Run `python pumpy.py -h` for options.
2. Using `import pumpy` in another script then calling the functions. See `example.py`.

## Issues

1. Harvard PHD2000 supports higher precision when setting flow rates/diameters than the Pump 11. At present everything is truncated for compatibility with the Pump 11.
2. PHD2000 requires "withdraw, stop, infuse" rather than "withdraw, infuse" otherwise it doesn't respond.
